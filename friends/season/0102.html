<p>[Scene Central Perk, everyone's there.]</p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> What you guys don't understand is, for us,
kissing is as important as any part of it. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Joey:</span> Yeah, right!.......Y'serious? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Phoebe:</span> Oh, yeah! </p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> Absolutely. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Chandler:</span> Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act,
y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd
comes out. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that...
that's not why we bought the ticket. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Chandler:</span> The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great
the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're
in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time
you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Joey:</span> (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?</p>

<p class="commercial">Opening Credits</p>

<p>[Scene: Museum of Prehistoric History, Ross and a co-worker
(Marsha) are setting up an exhibit which includes some mannequins of cave people.] </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little
angry? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Marsha:</span> Well, she has issues. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> Does she. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Marsha:</span> He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits
at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that
glacier's getting kinda close.' See? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Marsha:</span> Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? </p>

<p>(Carol, Ross's ex-wife, has entered behind them and is standing outstide the exhibit.) </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> (trying to ignore her) No. No. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Marsha:</span> Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in
the Ice Age. </p>

<p>(Marsha extis and Ross waves Carol into the exhibit.) </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span>Hi. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Carol:</span> So. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> You look great. I, uh... I hate that. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Carol:</span> Sorry. You look good too. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still,
uh... </p>

<p><span class = "character">Carol:</span> A lesbian? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Carol:</span> Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> Why- why are you here, Carol? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Carol:</span> I'm pregnant. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> Pregnant?! </p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler, Joey, Phoebe, and Monica are watching <em>Three's
Company</em>.]</p>

<p><span class = "character">Chandler:</span> Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's
Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Phoebe:</span>...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.) </p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Joey:</span> Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> Whose little ball of paper is this?! </p>

<p><span class = "character">Chandler:</span> Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I
realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him)
...now I wish I was dead. </p>

<p>(Monica starts to fluff a pillow.) </p>

<p><span class = "character">Phoebe:</span> She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already
fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine! </p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition
than they already have. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Chandler:</span> Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a
child's pillow. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Phoebe:</span> Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're
like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Joey:</span> Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every
time they come. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong.
Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Chandler:</span> (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! </p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> What? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Chandler:</span> Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster! </p>

<p><span class = "character">All:</span> Eeaagh! </p>

<p>(Rachel enters from her room.) </p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> Has anybody seen my engagement ring? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Phoebe:</span> Yeah, it's beautiful. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God.... (Starts to look under
the couch cushions.) </p>

<p><span class = "character">Phoebe:</span> No, look, don't touch that! </p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to
him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front
of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the
ring, which makes it so much harder... </p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we! </p>

<p><strong>Chandler and <span class = "character">Joey:</span> </strong>Oh! Yeah!</p>

<p ><span class = "character">Joey:</span> Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?</p>

<p ><span class = "character">Phoebe:</span> Doy! Probably right before she lost it! </p>

<p><span class = "character">Chandler:</span> You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days... </p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the
kitchen with... </p>

<p><span class = "character">Chandler:</span> ...Dinah? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad... </p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> You didn't. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> Oh, I am sorry... </p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of
the glass pan.) </p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> Oh, but look how straight those noodles are! </p>

<p><span class = "character">Chandler:</span> Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring
in a lasagne... </p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Chandler:</span> Boys? We're going in. </p>

<p>(Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe start to pick through the lasagne as there's a knock on the
door which Monica answers.) </p>

<p ><span class = "character">Ross:</span> (standing outside the door).....Hi. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> Wow. That is not a happy hi. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> Carol's pregnant. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Phoebe:</span> (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it! </p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about
now. (He enters.) </p>

<p><span class = "character">Chandler:</span> Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not
comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Phoebe:</span> She is so great! I miss her. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> What does she mean by 'involved'? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Chandler:</span> I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them
tomorrow. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> So what are you gonna do? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. </p>

<p>(Joey starts to eat the rest of the lasagne and everyone turns and stares at him.) </p>

<p><span class = "character">Joey:</span> .....Well, this is still ruined, right?</p>

<p >[Scene, Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Ross are pouring wine for their
parents.] </p>

<p><span class = "character">Mrs. Geller:</span> Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack)
Mmm! What's that curry taste? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> Curry. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Mrs. Geller:</span> Mmmm! </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> I- I think they're great! I, I really do. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Mr. Geller:</span> (To Ross) Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for
you, didn't she? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Mrs. Geller:</span> They all had a thing for him. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> Aw, Mom... </p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Mrs. Geller:</span> Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking,
or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant- </p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Mrs. Geller:</span> Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same
pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.) </p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) </p>

<p><span class = "character">Mrs. Geller:</span> Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you
planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some
of the heat off me. </p>

<p>[Time Lapse, everyone is now eating.] </p>

<p><span class = "character">Mrs. Geller:</span> What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the
club, they were not playing very well. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Mr. Geller:</span> I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty
thousand dollars is a lot of money! </p>

<p><span class = "character">Mrs. Geller:</span> Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... </p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> What's that supposed to mean? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Mrs. Geller:</span> Nothing! It's an expression. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> No it's not. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Mr. Geller:</span> Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have
been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were
just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles... </p>

<p>[Time Lapse.]</p>

<p ><span class = "character">Mr. Geller:</span> Look, there are people like Ross who
need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other
people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people
who never get cancer. </p>

<p>[Time Lapse.] </p>

<p><span class = "character">Mr. Geller:</span> ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank
God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on
with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to
share with the folks? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise
you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well,
here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant
with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. </p>

<p>(Stunned silence ensues.) </p>

<p><span class = "character">Mrs. Geller:</span> (To Monica) And you knew about this?! </p>

<p class="commercial">Commercial Break</p>

<p >[Scene: Central Park, everyone's there.] </p>

<p><span class = "character">Joey:</span> Your folks are really that bad, huh? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they
take their time, they get the job done. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you
could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> Must pee. (Goes to pee.) </p>

<p><span class = "character">Phoebe:</span> Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> You're twins? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Phoebe:</span> Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Chandler:</span> What does she do? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Phoebe:</span> She's a waitress. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to
leave.) </p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Chandler:</span> Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents
actually preferred. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> The lights, please..</p>

<p>(Joey turns off the lights, and they all leave as Rachel starts to clean up.&nbsp; Ross
enters from the bathroom.) </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> ...How long was I in there? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> I'm just cleaning up. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry
tomorrow? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> Oh.. a little.. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> Mm-hmm.. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> A lot. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> Mm. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's
gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too
terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give
Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... </p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> Got me. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> Remember when we were in high school together? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> Yeah. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love-
and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> Yes, yes! </p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his
hand.) </p>

<p>[Scene: Carol's OB/GYN, Carol is waiting.] </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big
dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. </p>

<p>(Susan enters holding a drink.) </p>

<p><span class = "character">Susan:</span> Hi. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Carol:</span> Ross, you remember Susan. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> How could I forget? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Susan:</span> Ross. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So,
uh, we're just waiting for...? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Carol:</span> Dr. Oberman. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- </p>

<p><span class = "character">Susan:</span> She. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Carol:</span> Yes, and she's very supportive. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.&nbsp; </p>

<p><span class = "character">Carol:</span> Thanks. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Carol:</span> Ross? That opens my cervix. (He drops it in horror.) </p>

<p>[Scene Barry's office, Barry is working on patient, Robbie, as Rachel enters.] </p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> Barry? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Barry:</span> C'mon in. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> (hesitates) Are you sure? </p>

when, like, important decisions have to be made? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Carol:</span> Give me a 'for instance'. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the
baby's name? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Carol:</span> Marlon- </p>

<p><span class = "character">Carol:</span> -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> Okay.. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Barry:</span> See, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you. More than I've ever wanted
to hurt anyone in my life. And I'm an orthodontist. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> Wow. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Barry:</span> You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren't
happy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit. </p>

you. And thank you for giving it to me. </p>
