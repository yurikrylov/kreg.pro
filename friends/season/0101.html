<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Joey, Phoebe, and Monica are there.]</p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy
I work with!</p>

<p><span class = "character">Joey:</span> C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's
gotta be something wrong with him!</p>

<p><span class = "character">Chandler:</span> <span class = "unseen">All right Joey, be
nice.&nbsp;</span>So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?</p>

<p><span class = "character">Phoebe:</span> Wait, does he eat chalk?</p>

<p>(They all stare, bemused.)</p>

<p><span class = "character">Phoebe:</span> Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through
what I went through with Carl- oh!</p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a
date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.</p>

<p><span class = "character">Chandler:</span> Sounds like a date to me.</p>

<p>[Time Lapse]</p>

<p><span class = "character">Chandler:</span> Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm
standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.</p>

<p><strong>All:</strong> Oh, yeah. Had that dream.</p>

<p><span class = "character">Chandler:</span> Then I look down, and I realize there's a
phone... there.</p>

<p><span class = "character">Joey:</span> Instead of...?</p>

<p><span class = "character">Chandler:</span> That's right.</p>

<p><span class = "character">Joey:</span> Never had that dream.</p>

<p><span class = "character">Phoebe:</span> No.</p>

<p><span class = "character">Chandler:</span> All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.
<span class = "unseen">Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me. </span></p>

<p><span class = "unseen"><span class = "character">Monica:</span> And they weren't looking at
you before?!</span></p>

<p><span class = "unseen"><span class = "character">Chandler:</span> Finally, I figure
I'd better answer it, </span>and it turns out it's my mother,
which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!</p>

<p>[Time Lapse, Ross has entered.]</p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> (mortified) Hi.</p>

<p><span class = "character">Joey:</span> This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.</p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> Are you okay, sweetie?</p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> I just feel like someone reached down my
throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my
neck...</p>

<p><span class = "character">Chandler:</span> Cookie?</p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> (explaining to the others) Carol moved her
stuff out today. </p>

<p><span class = "unseen"><span class = "character">Joey:</span> Ohh.</span></p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span><span class="unseen">
(to Ross) Let me get you some coffee. </span></p>

<p><span class = "unseen"><span class = "character">Ross:</span> Thanks.</span></p>

<p><span class = "character">Phoebe:</span> Ooh! Oh! (She starts to pluck at the air
just in front of Ross.)</p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just
leave my aura alone, okay?</p>

<p><span class = "unseen"><span class = "character">Phoebe:</span> Fine!&nbsp;Be murky!</span></p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> I'll be fine,
alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.</p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> No you don't.</p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!</p>

<p><span class = "character">Joey:</span> And you never knew she was a lesbian...</p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on
that? She didn't know, how should I know?</p>

<p><span class = "character">Chandler:</span> Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... (They
all stare at him.) Did I say that out loud?</p>

<p><span class = "unseen"><span class = "character">Ross:</span> I told mom and dad last night,
they seemed to take it pretty well.</span></p>

<p><span class = "unseen"><span class = "character">Monica:</span> Oh really, so that
hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., &quot;I'll never have
grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren.&quot; was what?&nbsp;A wrong number?</span></p>

<p><span class = "unseen"><span class = "character">Ross:</span> Sorry.</span></p>

<p><span class = "character">Joey:</span> Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of
pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?</p>

<p>(Ross gestures his consent.)</p>

<p><span class = "character">Joey:</span> Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some
hormones!</p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I
just- I just wanna be married again!</p>

<p>(Rachel enters in a wet wedding dress and starts to search
the room.)</p>

<p><span class = "character">Chandler:</span> And I just want a million dollars! (He
extends his hand hopefully.)</p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> Rachel?!</p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to
your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be
here and you are, you are!</p>

<p><strong>Waitress:</strong> Can I get you some coffee?</p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> (pointing at Rachel) De-caff. (to All) Okay,
everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (to Rachel) This is everybody,
this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> Hi, sure!</p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> Hi. </p>

<p>(They go to hug but Ross's umbrella opens.&nbsp;He sits
back down defeated again.&nbsp;A moment of silence follows as Rachel sits and the others
expect her to explain.)</p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting
for four wet bridesmaids?</p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> Oh God... well, it started about a half hour
before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was
looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden-
(to the waitress that brought her coffee)Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned
on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it
hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked
familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I
doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. (to Monica) So anyway I just didn't know where
to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I
knew who lived here in the city.</p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> Who wasn't invited to the wedding.</p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an
issue... [Scene: Monica's Apartment, everyone is there and watching a Spanish Soap on TV
and are trying to figure out what is going on.]</p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big
pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it. </p>

<p><span class = "unseen"><span class = "character">Chandler:</span> (imitating the characters)
Tuna or egg salad?&nbsp;Decide!</span></p>

<p><span class = "unseen"><span class = "character">Ross:</span> (in a deep voice) I'll have
whatever Christine is having.</span></p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> (on phone) Daddy, I just... I can't marry
him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me! </p>

<p><span class = "unseen">(The scene on TV has changed to show two
women, one is holding her hair.)</span></p>

<p><span class = "unseen"><span class = "character">Phoebe:</span>&nbsp;If I let go of
my hair, my head will fall off.</span> </p>

<p><span class = "character">Chandler:</span> (re TV) Ooh, she should not be wearing
those pants. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Joey:</span> I say push her down the stairs. </p>

<p><span class = "character">>Phoebe, Ross, Chandler, and Joey:</span>&nbsp;Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!</p>

<p>(She is pushed down the stairs and everyone cheers.)</p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's
like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a
shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a
shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you
to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!</p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> You can see where he'd have trouble.</p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll
just stay here with Monica. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> Well, I guess we've established who's
staying here with Monica...</p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe
I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!</p>

<p>[Time Lapse, Rachel is breating into a paper bag.]</p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try
to think of nice calm things...</p>

<p><span class = "character">Phoebe:</span> (sings) Raindrops on roses and rabbits and
kittens, (Rachel and Monica turn to look at her.) bluebells and sleighbells and- something
with mittens... La la la la...<span class = "unseen">something and noodles with
string.&nbsp;These are a few...</span></p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> I'm all better now.</p>

<p><span class = "character">Phoebe:</span> (grins and walks to the kitchen and says to
Chandler and Joey.) I helped!</p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> Okay, look, this is probably for the best,
y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.<span class = "unseen">&nbsp;The whole,
'hat' thing.</span></p>

<p><span class = "character">Joey:</span> (comforting her) And hey, you need anything,
you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.</p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding
day!</p>

<p><span class = "character">Joey:</span> What, like there's a rule or something?</p>

<p>(The door buzzer sounds and Chandler gets it.)</p>

<p><span class = "character">Chandler:</span> Please don't do that again, it's a
horrible sound.</p>

<p><strong><span class = "character">Paul:</span></strong> (over the intercom) It's, uh,
it's Paul.</p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span><span class = "unseen">Oh God, is it
6:30?&nbsp;</span>Buzz him in!</p>

<p><span class = "character">Joey:</span> Who's Paul?</p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?</p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> Maybe. <span class = "character">Joey:</span> Wait. Your 'not a real
date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?</p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> He finally asked you out?</p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> Yes!</p>

<p><span class = "character">Chandler:</span> Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.</p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> Rach, wait, I can cancel...</p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> Please, no, go, that'd be fine!</p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> (to Ross) Are, are you okay? I mean, do you
want me to stay?</p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> (choked voice) That'd be good...</p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> (horrified) Really?</p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> (normal voice) No, go on! It's Paul the Wine
Guy!</p>

<p><span class = "unseen"><span class = "character">Phoebe:</span> What does that mean?&nbsp;Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot? (Chandler doesn't know.)</span></p>

<p>(There's a knock on the door and it's Paul.)</p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. (They are all
lined up next to the door.)... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.</p>

<p><span class = "character">All:</span> Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!</p>

<p><span class = "character">Chandler:</span> I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul,
was it?</p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> <span class = "unseen">Okay, umm-umm, I'll
just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...</span></p>

<p><span class = "unseen"><span class = "character">Ross:</span> A wandering?</span></p>

<p><span class = "unseen"><span class = "character">Monica:</span> Change!&nbsp;Okay,
sit down. </span>(Shows Paul in) Two seconds.</p>

<p><span class = "character">Phoebe:</span> Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That
can't be good.</p>

<p><span class = "unseen">(Monica goes to change.)</span></p>

<p><span class = "unseen"><span class = "character">Joey:</span>&nbsp;Hey, Paul!</span></p>

<p><span class = "unseen"><span class = "character">Paul:</span> Yeah?</span></p>

<p><span class = "unseen"><span class = "character">Joey:</span> Here's a little tip, she
really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until
it starts to get a little red.</span></p>

<p><span class = "unseen"><span class = "character">Monica:</span> (yelling from the bedroom)
Shut up, Joey!</span></p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up
to tonight?</p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for
Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!</p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon,
God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- (thinks) -big
lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are
coming over to help me put together my new furniture.</p>

<p><span class = "character">Chandler:</span> (deadpan) Yes, and we're very excited
about it. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just
gonna hang out here tonight.&nbsp;<span class = "unseen">It's been kinda a long day.</span></p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> Okay, sure.</p>

<p><span class = "character">Joey:</span> Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?</p>

<p><span class = "character">Phoebe:</span> Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.</p>

change.]</span></p>

<p><span class = "unseen"><span class = "character">Phoebe:</span> (singing) Love is sweet as
summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is
like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart.&nbsp;La-la-la-la-la- (some guy gives her some
change and to that guy) Thank you. (sings) La-la-la-la...ohhh!</span></p>

<p>[Scene: Ross's Apartment, the guys are there assembling
furniture.]</p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> (squatting and reading the instructions) I'm
supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm
guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.</p>

<p><span class = "unseen">(Joey and Chandler are finishing assembling
the bookcase.)</span></p>

<p><span class = "unseen"><span class = "character">Joey:</span> I'm thinking we've got a
bookcase here.</span></p>

<p><span class = "unseen"><span class = "character">Chandler:</span> It's a beautiful thing.</span></p>

<p><span class = "character">Joey:</span> (picking up a leftover part) What's this?</p>

<p><span class = "unseen">Chandler:</span> I would have to
say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.</p>

<p><span class = "unseen"><span class = "character">Joey:</span> Which goes where?</span></p>

<p><span class = "character">Chandler:</span> I have no
idea.</p>

<p><span class = "character">Joey:</span> Done with the bookcase!</p>

<p><span class = "character">Chandler:</span> All finished!</p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> (clutching a beer can and sniffing) This was
Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.</p>

gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.</span></p>

<p><span class = "unseen"><span class = "character">Chandler:</span> Yes, please don't spoil
all this fun.</span></p>

<p><span class = "character">Joey:</span> Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the
furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?</p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> You guys.</p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> Oh my God!</p>

<p><span class = "character">Paul:</span> I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I
should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I
mean, how clean can teeth get?</p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> My brother's going through that right now,
he's such a mess. How did you get through it?</p>

<p><span class = "character">Paul:</span> Well, you might try accidentally breaking
something valuable of hers, say her-</p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> -leg?</p>

<p><span class = "character">Paul:</span> (laughing) That's one way! Me, I- I went for
the watch.</p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> You actually broke her watch?<span class = "unseen">&nbsp;Wow!&nbsp;The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by
boyfriend's favorite bath towel.</span></p>

<p><span class = "unseen"><span class = "character">Paul:</span> Ooh, steer clear of you.</span></p>

<p><span class = "unseen"><span class = "character">Monica:</span> That's right.</span>
[Scene: Monica's Apartment, Rachel is talking on the phone and pacing.]</p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know
you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love
with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- (She stops talking
and dials the phone.) Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...<span class = "unseen">look,
look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel,
but it isn't me, it's not me.&nbsp;And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but
you just have to give me a chance too... (The maching cuts her off again and she redials.)</span></p>

<p><span class = "unseen"><span class = "character">Chandler:</span> Look, Ross, you gotta
understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.&nbsp;<strong>You</strong>, however have had the love of a woman for four years.&nbsp;Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and
that is why we don't do it!&nbsp;I don't think that was my point!</span></p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> You know what the scariest part is? What if
there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's
it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...</p>

<p><span class = "character">Joey:</span> What are you talking about? 'One woman'?
That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something,
Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing!
Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the
best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight?
Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!</p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.</p>

noodles?</p>

<p><span class = "character">Paul:</span> No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda
revelation.</p>

<p><span class = "character">Paul:</span> Isn't there?</p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were
you gonna say?</p>

<p><span class = "character">Paul:</span> Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um,
I haven't been able to, uh, perform. (Monica takes a sip of her drink.) ...Sexually. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> (spitting out her drink in shock) Oh God, oh
God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...</p>

<p><span class = "character">Paul:</span> It's okay...</p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> I know being spit on is probably not what
you need right now. Um... how long?</p>

<p><span class = "character">Paul:</span> Two years.</p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!

<p><span class = "character">Joey:</span> Morning, Paul.</p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> Hello, Paul.</p>

<p><span class = "character">Chandler:</span> Hi, Paul, is it?</p>

<p>(Monica and Paul walk to the door and talk in a low voice
so the others can't hear.&nbsp;The others move Monica's table closer to the door so that
they can.)</p>

<p><span class = "unseen"><span class = "character">Paul:</span> Thank you!&nbsp;Thank you so
much!</span></p>

<p><span class = "unseen"><span class = "character">Monica:</span> Stop!</span></p>

<p><span class = "unseen"><span class = "character">Paul:</span> No, I'm telling you last night
was like umm, all my birthdays, both graduations, plus the barn raising scene in <em>Witness</em>.</span></p>

<p><span class = "unseen"><span class = "character">Monica:</span> We'll talk later.</span></p>

<p><span class = "character">Paul:</span> Yeah. (They kiss) Thank you. (Exits)</p>

<p><span class = "character">Joey:</span> That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you
do on a real date?</p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> Shut up, and put my table back.</p>

<p><span class = "character">All:</span> Okayyy! (They do so.)</p>

<p><span class = "character">Chandler:</span> All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I
don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference... </p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> So, like, you guys all have jobs?</p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we
buy stuff.</p>

<p><span class = "character">Joey:</span> Yeah, I'm an actor.</p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?</p>

<p><span class = "character">Joey:</span> I doubt it. Mostly regional work.</p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch
the Reruns' production of Pinocchio<span class = "unseen">, at the little theater in the
park.</span></p>

<p><span class = "unseen"><span class = "character">Joey:</span> Look, it was a job all right?</span></p>

<p><span class = "character">Chandler:</span> 'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'</p>

<p><span class = "character">Joey:</span> I will not take this abuse. (Walks to the door
and opens it to leave.)</p>

<p><span class = "character">Chandler:</span> You're right, I'm sorry. (Burst into song
and dances out of the door.) &quot;<em>Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy...</em>&quot;</p>

<p><span class = "unseen"><span class = "character">Joey:</span> You should both know,
that he's a dead man.&nbsp;Oh, Chandler? (Starts after Chandler.)</span> </p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay?
Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.</p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> I can see that. You look like you slept with
a hanger in your mouth.</p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember
you and Tony DeMarco?</p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> Well, it's like that. With feelings.</p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> Oh wow. Are you in trouble.</p>

<p><span class = "unseen"><span class = "character">Monica:</span> Big time!</span></p>

<p><span class = "unseen"><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> Want a wedding dress?&nbsp;Hardly used.</span></p>

<p><span class = "unseen"><span class = "character">Monica:</span> I think we are getting
a little ahead of selves here.</span> Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work
and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.</p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> Oh, look, wish me luck!</p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> What for?</p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> I'm gonna go get one of those (Thinks) job
things.</p>

<p>(Monica exits.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Iridium, Monica is working as Frannie enters.] </p>

<p><span class = "character">Frannie:</span> Hey, Monica! </p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Frannie:</span> You had sex, didn't you? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> How do you do that?</p>

<p><span class = "unseen"><span class = "character">Frannie:</span> Oh, I hate you, I'm pushing my Aunt Roz through
Parrot Jungle and you're having sex!&nbsp;</span>So? Who? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> You know Paul? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Frannie:</span> Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> You mean you know Paul like I know Paul? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Frannie:</span> Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y'know before me, there was no
snap in his turtle for two years. </p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, everyone but Rachel is there.]</p>

<p><span class = "character">Joey:</span> (sitting on the arm of the couch)Of course it was a line! </p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you
into bed'. </p>

<p><span class = "unseen"><strong>Monica: </strong>I hate men!&nbsp;I hate men!</span></p>

<p><span class = "unseen"><span class = "character">Phoebe:</span> Oh no, don't hate, you don't
want to put that out into the universe.</span></p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of
beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Phoebe:</span> All right, c'mere, gimme your feet. (She starts massaging them.) </p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> I just thought he was nice, y'know? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Joey:</span> (bursts out laughing again) I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!
</p>

<p>(Monica pushes him off of the sofa as Rachel enters with a shopping bag.) </p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> Guess what? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> You got a job? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve
interviews today. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Chandler:</span> And yet you're surprisingly upbeat. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty
percent off! </p>

<p><span class = "character">Chandler:</span> Oh, how well you know me... </p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got
great boots' boots! </p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> How'd you pay for them? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> Uh, credit card. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> And who pays for that? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> Um... my... father. </p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone is sitting around the kitchen table.&nbsp;Rachel's credit cards are spread out on the table along with a pair of scissors.]</p>

<p><span class = "unseen"><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> Oh God, come on you
guys, is this really necessary?&nbsp;I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.</span> </p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> I know that. That's why I was getting married. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Phoebe:</span> Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> Thank you. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Phoebe:</span> You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was
fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got
here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like,
cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found
aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel. </p>

<p>(Pause) </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'... </p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> <span class = "unseen">All right, </span>you ready?</p>

<p><span class = "unseen"><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> No.&nbsp;No, no, I'm not
ready!&nbsp;How can I be ready?&nbsp;&quot;Hey, Rach!&nbsp;You ready to jump out the
airplane without your parachute?&quot;&nbsp;Come on, I can't do this!</span></p>

<p><span class = "unseen"><span class = "character">Monica:</span> You can, I know you
can!</span> </p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> I don't think so.</p>

<p><span class = "unseen"><span class = "character">Ross:</span> Come on, you made
coffee! &nbsp;You can do anything! (Chandler slowly tries to hide the now dead plant from
that morning when he and Joey poured their coffee into it.)</span></p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,... </p>

<p><span class = "character">All:</span> Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut... (She cuts one of them and they cheer.)</p>

<p><span class = "unseen"><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> Y'know what?&nbsp;I think
we can just leave it at that.&nbsp; It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...</span></p>

<p><span class = "unseen"><span class = "character">Monica:</span>&nbsp; Rachel!&nbsp;
That was a library card!</span> </p>

<p><span class = "character">All:</span> Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..</p>

<p><span class = "unseen"><span class = "character">Chandler:</span> (as Rachel is cutting up
her cards) Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream. </span></p>

<p><span class = "unseen">(She finishes cutting them up and they all
cheer.)</span></p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're
gonna love it! </p>

<p>[Time Lapse, Rachel and Ross are watching a TV channel finishes it's broadcast day by
playing the national anthem.] </p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> Well, that's it (To Ross) You gonna crash on the couch? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> No. No, I gotta go home sometime. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> You be okay? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> Yeah. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. (Monica smiles.) What? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy.
Alright. Goodnight, everybody. </p>

<p><span class = "unseen"><span class = "character">Ross and Rachel:</span> Goodnight.</span></p>

<p>(Monica stomps on Paul's watch and goes into her room.)</p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> Mmm. (They both reach for the last cookie) Oh, no- </p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> Sorry- </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> No no no, go- </p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> No, you have it, really, I don't want it- </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> Split it? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> Okay. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> Okay. (They split it.) You know you probably didn't know this, but back in
high school, I had a, um, major crush on you. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> I knew. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky
older brother. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> I did. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability
become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out?
Sometime? Maybe? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> Yeah, maybe... </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> Okay... okay, maybe I will... </p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> Goodnight. </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> Goodnight. </p>

<p>(Rachel goes into her room and Monica enters the living room as Ross is leaving.) </p>

<p><span class = "character">Monica:</span> See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you? </p>

<p><span class = "character">Ross:</span> I just grabbed a spoon. (Ross exits and Monica has no idea what that
means.) </p>

</p>

<p><span class = "character">Rachel:</span> (walks up with a pot of coffee) Would anybody like more coffee? </p>
